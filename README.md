# Maya_ToolCreation

#This custom tool that I created for Maya has a variety of features. It first allows for users to procedurally generate and edit their desired primitive objects and scatter them around the scene. It also creates and assigns random lambert shaders to those created objects. Thirdly it allows for an outside file, in this case any ".mb", to be imported into the scene and applies both a passive rigid body to their imported object and active rigid bodies to their created objects. Finally users can playback their animation to see their creation in action.
